        This recipe is a delicious basic Italian lasagna. It's cheesey, garlicy, and hits all those lasagna notes. 
        <br>
        You won't even notice there's no meat. I hope you enjoy this recipe as much as my family does.

            <li>2 TBSP Olive Oil</li>
            <li>1 Shallot</li>
            <li>1 Bulb Garlic</li>
            <li>2 16oz Cans of Beans (I use Cannelli)</li>

            <li>1 28oz Can Diced Tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 6oz Can Tomatoe Paste</li>
            <li>¼ TSP Crushed Rerd Pepper Flakes</li>
            <li>1 TVSP Sugar</li>
            <li>1 ½ TSP Basil, Dried</li>
            <li>1 TSP Italian Season</li>
            <li>Saly and Pepper (amounts in directions)</li>
            <li>1 Egg</li>
            <li>12 oz Ricotta Cheese</li>
            <li>½ Cup Shredded Parmesan Cheese</li>
            <li>2 Cups Shredded Mozzarella Cheese (or an Italian Blend)</li>
            <li>½ Cup Fresh Chopped Parsley</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to package directions. <br>
                Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350°F and grease 13x9 inch a baking dish. <br>
                As the noodles cook, you can work on the other components. <br>
                When cooked, drain the noodles. If you're not yet ready to combine the lasagna, <br>
                place noodles in a pot or bowl of cold water to prevent noodles from sticking together.</li>
                <br>
            <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, saute the shallot and garlic in olive oil until tender. <br>
                Add both cans of tomatoes, tomato paste, crushed red pepper flakes, sugar, basil, Italian <br>
                seasoning, 1 tsp salt and ½ tsp pepper. Simmer on low for 1 1/2 hours. <br>
                After removing from heat, stir in 1/4 cup of the fresh chopped parsley.</li>
                <br>
            <li>In a medium bowl combine the beaten egg, ricotta, Parmesan, and mozzarella (or Italian Blend) <br>
                cheeses, 1/2 tsp salt and the other 1/4 cup of fresh chopped parsley</li>
                <br>
            <li>Spread approximately 1/2 - 1 cup of bean/sauce mixture on the bottom of the pan, layer with 3 noodles. <br> 
                Top noodles with 1/2 the cheese mixture. Repeat by topping that with 1/3 of remaining bean/sauce <br>
                mixture, 3 noodles, and the last 1/2 of cheese mixture. Finally, add another 1/3 of the <br>
                bean/sauce mixture, layer 3 noodles, the last 1/3 of the bean mixture, and top with a sprinkling <br>
                of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Cover with foil and bake for 45 minutes. Uncover and bake for an additional 15 minutes or until the <br>
                cheese on top becomes bubbly. Let stand at least 10 minutes before cutting and servinges.</li>
        </ol>
