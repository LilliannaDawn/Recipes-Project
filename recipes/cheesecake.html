            <li>2 Packages Cream Cheese, 250g each</li>
            <li>½ cup sugar</li>
            <li>½ tsp vanilla</li>
            <li>2 Eggs</li>
            <li>1 Ready to Use Graham Cracker Crumb Crust, 9-inch</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat your oven to 190-200°F. Oven's varry slightly so use your best judgement. <br>
                This is also such a low temperature that you don't have to worry to much. <br>
                You can also add a vessle of hot water, but  it's not necessary.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Beat the cream cheese, vanilla, and sugar in a medium bowl until blended. <br>
                Add eggs; beat just until incorporated.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Pour into your ready to use crumb crust. Store bought is fine, but feel free to <br>
                make you're own if you have a favorite recipe.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Bake for 4 hours or until the center of the custard gets to 165°F. <br>
                It will be “jiggly” but set aside to cool. It will firm up and be ready to eat <br>
                once it's cooled off for 2-4 hours.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Top with your favorite fruit, pie filling, or fruit puree. You can also drizzle your cheesecake <br>
                with chocolate or dust with cocoa powder. You can even add a your favorite cookies <br>
                by crumbling them up and sprinkling them on top. Have fun and make this recipe yours!</li>
