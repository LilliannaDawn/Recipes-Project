        These fried mozzarella sticks are simple and easy to make. I'm sure they'll be a hit!
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Eggs, Beaten</li>
            <li>¼ Cup Water</li>
            <li>1 ½ Cups Italian Seasoned Bread Crumbs</li>
            <li>½ TSP Garlic Powder</li>
            <li>⅔ Cup All Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>⅓ Cup Cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 Quart Oil (for deep frying)</li>
            <li>1 16 ounce Package Mozzarella Cheese Sticks </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix the eggs and water.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Mix the bread crumbs, half of the flour and garlic powder in <br>
                a medium bowl. In another medium bowl, blend half <br>
                the flour and cornstarch.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Cut the cheese sticks in half this makes them easier to work with.</li>
                <br>
            <li>One at a time, coat each mozzarella stick in the flour mixture, then <br>
                the egg mixture, then in the bread crumbs. Place them on a baking <br>
                sheet covered in wax paper as you assemble them. When you finish <br>
                place the the tray in the freezer for about 30 minutes. This is KEY! <br>
                This keeps the cheese from melting the second it hits the oil and <br>
                allows the coating to get crisp first.</li>
                <br>
            <li>In a large heavy saucepan, heat the oil to 365°F (185°C).</li>
                <br>
            <li>Fry until golden brown, about 30 seconds. Remove from heat <br>
                and drain on paper towels.</li>
                <br>
        </ol>
